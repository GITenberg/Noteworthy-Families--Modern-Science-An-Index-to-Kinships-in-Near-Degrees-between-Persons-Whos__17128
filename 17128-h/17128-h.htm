  <p>The brief biographical notices of sixty-six noteworthy families
  printed in this book are compiled from replies to a circular issued by
  me in the spring of 1904 to all living Fellows of the Royal Society.
  Those that first arrived were discussed in &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; August
  11, 1904.</p>

  <p>On Mr. Schuster's appointment by the University of London, in
  October, 1904, to the Research Fellowship in National Eugenics, all my
  materials were placed in his hand. He was to select from them those
  families that contained at least three noteworthy kinsmen, to compile
  lists of their achievements on the model of the above-mentioned memoir,
  to verify statements as far as possible, and to send what he wrote for
  final approval by the authors of the several replies.</p>

  <p>This was done by Mr. Schuster. The results were then submitted by him
  as an appendix to his Report to the Senate last summer.</p>

  <p>After preliminary arrangements, it was determined by the Senate that
  the list of Noteworthy Families should be published according to the
  title-page of this book, I having agreed to contribute the <a name=
  "Page_R8" id="Page_R8"></a>preface, Mr. Schuster's time being fully
  occupied with work in another branch of Eugenics.</p>

  <p>So the list of &ldquo;Noteworthy Families&rdquo; in this volume is
  entirely the work of Mr. Schuster, except in respect to some slight
  alterations and additions for which I am responsible, as well as for all
  the rest.</p>

  <h2><a name="Page_R9" id="Page_R9"></a><a name="PREFACE" id=
  "PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <h3><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I"></a>Chapter I.&mdash;General
  Remarks.</h3>

  <p>This volume is the first instalment of a work that admits of wide
  extension. Its object is to serve as an index to the achievements of
  those families which, having been exceptionally productive of noteworthy
  persons, seem especially suitable for biographical investigation.</p>

  <p>The facts that are given here are avowedly bald and imperfect;
  nevertheless, they lead to certain important conclusions. They show, for
  example, that a considerable proportion of the noteworthy members in a
  population spring from comparatively few families.</p>

  <p>The material upon which this book is based is mainly derived from the
  answers made to a circular sent to all the Fellows of the Royal Society
  whose names appear in its Year Book for 1904.</p>

  <p>The questions were not unreasonably numerous, nor were they
  inquisitorial; nevertheless, it proved that not one-half of those who
  were addressed cared to answer them. It was, of course, desirable to
  know a great deal more than could have been asked for or published with
  propriety, such as the proneness <a name="Page_R10" id="Page_R10"></a>of
  particular families to grave constitutional disease. Indeed, the secret
  history of a family is quite as important in its eugenic aspect as its
  public history; but one cannot expect persons to freely unlock their
  dark closets and drag forth family skeletons into the light of day. It
  was necessary in such a work as this to submit to considerable
  limitations, while turning to the fullest account whatever could be
  stated openly without giving the smallest offence to any of the persons
  concerned.</p>

  <p>One limitation against which I still chafe in vain is the
  impracticability of ascertaining so apparently simple a matter as the
  number of kinsfolk of each person in each specific degree of near
  kinship, without troublesome solicitations. It was specially asked for
  in the circular, but by no means generally answered, even by those who
  replied freely to other questions. The reason must in some cases have
  been mere oversight or pure inertia, but to a large extent it was due to
  ignorance, for I was astonished to find many to whom the number of even
  their near kinsfolk was avowedly unknown. Emigration, foreign service,
  feuds between near connections, differences of social position,
  faintness of family interest, each produced their several effects, with
  the result, as I have reason to believe, that hardly one-half of the
  persons addressed were able, without first making inquiry of others, to
  reckon the number of their uncles, adult nephews, and first cousins. The
  isolation of some few from even their nearest relatives was occasionally
  so complete that the<a name="Page_R11" id="Page_R11"></a> number of
  their brothers was unknown. It will be seen that this deficiency of
  information admits of being supplied indirectly, to a considerable
  degree.</p>

  <p>The collection of even the comparatively small amount of material now
  in hand proved much more troublesome than was anticipated, but as the
  object and limitations of inquiries like this become generally
  understood, and as experience accumulates, the difficulty of similar
  work in the future will presumably lessen.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II"></a>Chapter
  II.&mdash;Noteworthiness.</h3>

  <p>The Fellowship of the Royal Society is a distinction highly
  appreciated by all members of the scientific world. Fifteen men are
  annually selected by its council out of some sixty candidates, each
  candidate being proposed by six, and usually by more, Fellows in a
  certificate containing his qualifications. The candidates themselves are
  representatives of a multitude of persons to whom the title would be not
  only an honour but a material advantage. The addition of the letters
  &ldquo;F.R.S.&rdquo; to the names of applicants to any post, however
  remotely connected with science, is a valuable testimonial and a
  recognised aid towards success, so the number of those who desire it is
  very large. Experience shows that no special education, other than
  self-instruction, is really required to attain this honour. Access to
  laboratories, good tuition, and so forth, are doubtless helpful, so far
  <a name="Page_R12" id="Page_R12"></a>that many have obtained the
  distinction through such aid who could not otherwise have done so, but
  they are far from being all-important factors of success. The facts that
  lie patent before the eyes of every medical man, engineer, and the
  members of most professions, afford ample material for researches that
  would command the attention of the scientific world if viewed with
  intelligence and combined by a capable mind.</p>

  <p>It is so difficult to compare the number of those who might have
  succeeded with the number of those who do, that the following
  illustration may perhaps be useful: By adding to the 53 registration
  counties in England, the 12 in Wales, the 33 in Scotland and the 32 in
  Ireland, an aggregate of 130 is obtained. The English counties, and the
  others in a lesser degree, have to be ransacked in order to supply the
  fifteen annually-elected Fellows; so it requires more than eight of
  these counties to yield an annual supply of a single Fellow to the Royal
  Society.</p>

  <p>It is therefore contended that the Fellows of the Royal Society have
  sufficient status to be reckoned &ldquo;noteworthy,&rdquo; and, such
  being the case, they are a very convenient body for inquiries like
  these. They are trained to, and have sympathy with, scientific
  investigations; biographical notices are published of them during their
  lifetime, notably in the convenient compendium &ldquo;Who's Who,&rdquo;
  to which there will be frequent occasion to refer; and they are more or
  less known to one another, either directly or through friends, making it
  comparatively easy to satisfy the <a name="Page_R13" id=
  "Page_R13"></a>occasional doubts which may arise from their
  communications. It was easier and statistically safer to limit the
  inquiry to those Fellows who were living when the circulars were
  issued&mdash;that is, to those whose names and addresses appear in the
  &ldquo;Royal Society's Year Book&rdquo; of 1904. Some of them have since
  died, full of honours, having done their duty to their generation;
  others have since been elected; so the restriction given here to the
  term &ldquo;Modern Science&rdquo; must be kept in mind.</p>

  <p>Another and a strong motive for selecting the F.R.S. as subjects of
  inquiry was that so long ago as 1863-1864 I had investigated the
  antecedents of 180 of those who were then living, who were further
  distinguished by one or other of certain specified and recognised
  honours. My conclusions were briefly described in a Friday evening
  lecture, February 27, 1864, before the Royal Institution. These,
  together with the data on which they were founded, were published in the
  same year in my book &ldquo;English Men of Science.&rdquo; Readers who
  desire fuller information as to the antecedents conducive to success
  that are too briefly described further on should refer to the above
  book.</p>

  <p>The epithet &ldquo;noteworthy&rdquo; is applied to achievements in
  all branches of effort that rank among the members of any profession or
  calling as equal, at least, to that which an F.R.S. holds among
  scientific men. This affords a convenient and sufficiently definite
  standard of merit. I could think of none more appropriate when
  addressing scientific men, <a name="Page_R14" id="Page_R14"></a>and it
  seems to have been generally understood in the desired sense. It
  includes more than a half of those whose names appear in the modern
  editions of &ldquo;Who's Who,&rdquo; which are become less discriminate
  than the earlier ones. &ldquo;Noteworthiness&rdquo; is ascribed, without
  exception, to all whose names appear in the &ldquo;Dictionary of
  National Biography,&rdquo; but all of these were dead before the date of
  the publication of that work and its supplement. Noteworthiness is also
  ascribed to those whose biographies appear in the
  &ldquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rdquo; (which includes many who are
  now alive), and, in other works, of equivalent authority. As those
  persons were considered by editors of the last named publications to be
  worthy of note, I have accepted them, on their authority, as
  noteworthy.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"></a>Chapter
  III.&mdash;Highest Order of Ability.</h3>

  <p>No attempt is made in this book to deal with the transmission of
  ability of the very highest order, as the data in hand do not furnish
  the required material, nor will the conclusions be re-examined at length
  that I published many years ago in &ldquo;Hereditary Genius.&rdquo;
  Still, some explanation is desirable to show the complexity of the
  conditions that are concerned with the hereditary transmission of the
  highest ability, which, for the moment, will be considered as the same
  thing as the highest fame.</p>

  <p>It has often been remarked that the men who <a name="Page_R15" id=
  "Page_R15"></a>have attained pinnacles of celebrity failed to leave
  worthy successors, if any. Many concurrent causes aid in producing this
  result. An obvious one is that such persons are apt to be so immersed in
  their pursuit, and so wedded to it, that they do not care to be
  distracted by a wife. Another is the probable connection between severe
  mental strain and fertility. Women who study hard have, as a
  class&mdash;at least, according to observant caricaturists&mdash;fewer
  of the more obvious feminine characteristics; but whether this should be
  considered a cause or a consequence, or both, it is difficult to say. A
  third, and I think the most important, reason why the children of very
  distinguished persons fall sometimes lamentably short of their parents
  in ability is that the highest order of mind results from a fortunate
  mixture of incongruous constituents, and not of such as naturally
  harmonize. Those constituents are <i>negatively</i> correlated, and
  therefore the compound is unstable in heredity. This is eminently the
  case in the typical artistic temperament, which certainly harmonizes
  with Bohemianism and passion, and is opposed to the useful qualities of
  regularity, foresight, and level common sense. Where these and certain
  other incongruous faculties go together in well-adjusted proportions,
  they are capable of achieving the highest success; but their heritage is
  most unlikely to be transmitted in its entirety, and ill-balanced
  compounds of the same constituents are usually of little avail, and
  sometimes extraordinarily bad. A fourth reason is that the highest
  imaginative power is dangerously near <a name="Page_R16" id=
  "Page_R16"></a>lunacy. If one of the sanest of poets, Wordsworth, had,
  as he said, not unfrequently to exert strength, as by shaking a
  gate-post, to gain assurance that the world around him was a reality,
  his mind could not at those times have been wholly sane. Sanity is
  difficult to define, except negatively; but, even though we may be
  convinced of the truths of the mystic, that nothing is what it seems to
  be, the above-mentioned conduct suggests temporary insanity. It is
  sufficient to conclude, as any Philistine would, that whoever has to
  shake a gate-post to convince himself that it is not a vision is
  dangerously near madness. Mad people do such things; those who carry on
  the work of the world as useful and law-abiding citizens do not. I may
  add that I myself had the privilege of hearing at first hand the
  narrator's own account of this incident, which was much emphasized by
  his gestures and tones. Wordsworth's unexpected sally was in reply to a
  timid question by the late Professor Bonamy Price, then a young man,
  concerning the exact meaning of the lines in his famous &ldquo;Ode to
  Immortality,&rdquo; &ldquo;not for these I raise the song of praise; but
  for those obstinate <i>questionings of sense and outward
  things</i>,&rdquo; etc.</p>

  <p>I cannot speak from the present returns, but only from my own private
  knowledge of the somewhat abnormal frequency with which eccentricity, or
  other mental unsoundness, occurs in the families of very able scientific
  men. Lombroso, as is well known, strongly asserted the truth of this
  fact, but more strongly, as it seems to myself, than the evidence
  warrants.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_R17" id="Page_R17"></a>It is, therefore, not in the
  highest examples of human genius that heredity can be most profitably
  studied, men of high, but not of the highest, ability being more
  suitable. The only objection to their use is that their names are, for
  the most part, unfamiliar to the public.</p>

  <p>The vastness of the social world is very imperfectly grasped by its
  several members, the large majority of the numerous persons who have
  been eminent above their far more numerous fellows, each in his own
  special department, being unknown to the generality. The merits of such
  men can be justly appreciated only by reference to records of their
  achievements. Let no reader be so conceited as to believe his present
  ignorance of a particular person to be a proof that the person in
  question does not merit the title of noteworthy.</p>

  <p>I said what I have to say about the modern use of the word
  &ldquo;genius&rdquo; in the preface to the second edition of my
  &ldquo;Hereditary Genius.&rdquo; It has only latterly lost its old and
  usual meaning, which is preserved in the term of an
  &ldquo;ingenious&rdquo; artisan, and has come to be applied to something
  akin to inspiration. This simply means, as I suppose, though some may
  think differently, that the powers of unconscious work possessed by the
  brain are abnormally developed in them. The heredity of these powers has
  not, I believe, been as yet especially studied. It is strange that more
  attention has not been given until recently to unconscious brain-work,
  because it is by far the most potent factor in <a name="Page_R18" id=
  "Page_R18"></a>mental operations. Few people, when in rapid
  conversation, have the slightest idea of the particular form which a
  sentence will assume into which they have hurriedly plunged, yet through
  the guidance of unconscious cerebration it develops itself grammatically
  and harmoniously. I write on good authority in asserting that the best
  speaking and writing is that which seems to flow automatically shaped
  out of a full mind.</p>

  IV.&mdash;Proportion of Noteworthies to the Generality.</h3>

  <p>The materials on which the subject of this chapter depends are too
  various to lead to a single definite and trustworthy answer. Men who
  have won their way to the front out of uncongenial environments owe
  their success principally, I believe, to their untiring energy, and to
  an exceptionally strong inclination in youth towards the pursuits in
  which they afterwards distinguished themselves. They do not seem often
  to be characterized by an ability that continues pre-eminent on a wider
  stage, because after they have fully won a position for themselves, and
  become engaged in work along with others who had no early difficulties
  to contend with, they do not, as a rule, show greatly higher natural
  ability than their colleagues. This is noticeable in committees and in
  other assemblies or societies where intellects are <a name="Page_R19"
  id="Page_R19"></a>pitted against one another. The bulk of existing
  noteworthies seem to have had but little more than a fair education as
  small boys, during which their eagerness and aptitude for study led to
  their receiving favour and facilities. If, in such cases, the aptitudes
  are scholastic, a moderate sum suffices to give the boy a better
  education, enabling him to win scholarships and to enter a University.
  If they lie in other directions, the boy attracts notice from some more
  congenial source, and is helped onwards in life by other means. The
  demand for exceptional ability, when combined with energy and good
  character, is so great that a lad who is gifted with them is hardly more
  likely to remain overlooked than a bird's nest in the playground of a
  school. But, by whatever means noteworthiness is achieved, it is usually
  after a course of repeated and half-unconscious testings of
  intelligence, energy, and character, which build up repute brick by
  brick.</p>

  <p>If we compare the number of those who achieved noteworthiness through
  their own exertions with the numbers of the greatly more numerous
  persons whose names are registered in legal, clerical, medical,
  official, military, and naval directories, or in those of the titled
  classes<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and landed gentry, or lastly,
  of those of the immense commercial world, the proportion <a name=
  "Page_R20" id="Page_R20"></a>of one noteworthy person to one hundred of
  the generality who were equally well circumstanced as himself does not
  seem to be an over-estimate.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p style="text-indent:0;"><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href=
    "#FNanchor_A_1">[A]</a> By a rough count of the entries in Burke's
    &ldquo;Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage,&rdquo; I find that upwards
    of 24,000 ladies are of sufficient rank to be included by name in his
    Table of Precedence.</p>

  <h3><a name="Chapter_V" id="Chapter_V"></a>Chapter
  V.&mdash;Noteworthiness as a Measure of Ability.</h3>

  <p>Success is the joint result of the natural powers of mind and body,
  and of favourable circumstances. Those of the latter which fall into
  definite groups will be distinguished as &ldquo;environment,&rdquo;
  while the others, which evade classification, will be called
  &ldquo;accidental.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The superstitions of old times cling so tenaciously to modern thought
  that the words &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and &ldquo;chance&rdquo; commonly
  connote some mysterious agency. Nothing of the kind is implied here. The
  word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and the like is used in these pages simply
  to express the effect of unknown or unnoted causes, without the
  slightest implication that they are unknowable. In most cases their
  neglect has been partly due to their individual insignificance, though
  their combined effect may be very powerful when a multitude work in the
  same direction. Moreover, a trifling pressure at the right spot suffices
  to release a hair-trigger and thereby to cause an explosion; similarly,
  with personal and social events, a trifling accident will sometimes
  determine a career.</p>

  <p>Noteworthiness and success may be regarded <a name="Page_R21" id=
  "Page_R21"></a>statistically as the outcome of ability and environment
  and of nothing else, because the effects of chance tend to be eliminated
  by statistical treatment. The question then becomes, How far may
  noteworthiness be accepted as a statistical measure of ability?</p>

  <p>Ability and environment are each composed of many elements that
  differ greatly in character. Ability may be especially strong in
  particular directions as in administration, art, scholarship, or
  science; it is, nevertheless, so adaptive that an able man has often
  found his way to the front under more than one great change of
  circumstance. The force that impels towards noteworthy deeds is an
  innate disposition in some men, depending less on circumstances than in
  others. They are like ships that carry an auxiliary steam-power, capable
  of moving in a dead calm and against adverse winds. Others are like the
  ordinary sailing ships of the present day&mdash;they are stationary in a
  calm, but can make some way towards their destination under almost any
  wind. Without a stimulus of some kind these men are idle, but almost any
  kind of stimulus suffices to set them in action. Others, again, are like
  Arab dhows, that do little more than drift before the monsoon or other
  wind; but then they go fast.</p>

  <p>Environment is a more difficult topic to deal with, because
  conditions that are helpful to success in one pursuit may be detrimental
  in another. High social rank and wealth conduce to success in political
  life, but their distractions and claims clash with <a name="Page_R22"
  id="Page_R22"></a>quiet investigation. Successes are of the most varied
  descriptions, but those registered in this book are confined to such as
  are reputed honourable, and are not obviously due to favour.</p>

  <p>In attacking the problem it therefore becomes necessary to fix the
  attention, in the first instance, upon the members of some one large,
  special profession, as upon artists, leaders in commerce, investigators,
  scholars, warriors, and so forth, then to divide these into subclasses,
  until more appears to be lost through paucity of material than is gained
  through its increasing homogeneity.</p>

  <p>Whatever group be selected, both ability and environment must be
  rated according to the requirements of that group. It then becomes
  possible, and it is not difficult, to roughly array individuals under
  each of these two heads successively, and to label every person with
  letters signifying his place in either class. For purposes of the
  following explanation, each quality will be distributed into three
  grades, determined not by value, but by class place&mdash;namely, the
  highest third, the medium third, and the lowest third. In respect to
  ability, these classes will be called A, B, and C. In respect to
  environment, the grades will refer to its helpfulness towards the
  particular success achieved, and the classes will be called E, F, G. It
  must be clearly understood that the differences between the grades do
  not profess to be equal, merely that A is higher than B, and B than C;
  similarly as to E, F, and G. The A, B, C may be quite independent of E,
  F, G, <a name="Page_R23" id="Page_R23"></a>or they may be correlated.
  Both cases will be considered.</p>

  <p>Ability and Environment being mutually helpful towards success, the
  successes statistically associated with AE will be reckoned higher than
  those associated with AF. Again, for simplicity of explanation only, it
  will here be assumed that Ability and Environment are equally potent in
  securing success. Any other reasonable relation between their influences
  may be substituted for the purpose of experiment, but the ultimate
  conclusion will be much the same.</p>

  <table class="spaced all" border="1" summary="This table shows the nine possible combinations of three levels of Ability and three levels of Favourable Environment, and labels each combination with a Grade I, II or III according to how successful each is expected to be.">

  <p>First, suppose Ability and Environment to be entirely independent, A
  being as frequently associated with E as it is with F or with G;
  similarly as regards B and C, then the nine combinations shown in <a href="#table1">Table
  I.</a> will be equally frequent. These tabular entries fall into three equal
  groups. The three that lie in and about the upper left-hand corner
  contain the highest constituents&mdash;namely, either <i>high</i>
  combined with <i>high</i>, or one <i>high</i> with one <i>medium</i>.
  They produce Successes of Grade I. The three in <a name="Page_R24" id=
  "Page_R24"></a>the middle diagonal band running between the lower left
  and the upper right corners are either one <i>high</i> and one
  <i>low</i>, or both are <i>medium</i>; they will produce Successes of
  Grade II. The three in and about the right-hand corner are either one
  <i>medium</i> with one <i>low</i>, or both are <i>low</i>; they will
  produce Successes of Grade III. This is still more clearly seen by
  sorting the results into <a href="#table2">Table II.</a>, from which it is clear that a high
  grade of Success is statistically associated with a high, but less,
  grade of Ability, a medium with a medium, and a low grade of Success
  with a low, but less low, grade of Ability.</p>

  <table class="spaced cols" summary="This table, derived from the previous one, shows for each Grade of Success the frequency of the various levels of Ability.  To an extent, it shows higher Success corresponding to higher Ability.">

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Secondly, suppose A, B, C to be correlated with E, F, G, so that A is
  more likely to be associated with E than it is with F, and much more
  likely than with G. Similarly, C is most likely to be associated with G,
  less likely with F, and least likely with E. The general effect of these
  preferences will be well represented by divorcing the couples which
  differ by two grades&mdash;namely, AG and CE, by re-mating their
  constituents as AE and CG, and by re-sorting <a name="Page_R25" id=
  "Page_R25"></a>them, as in <a href="#table3">Table III.</a> The couples that differ by no more
  than one grade are left undisturbed. The results now fall into five
  grades of Success, in four of which each grade contains two-ninths of
  the whole number, and one, the medium Grade 3, contains only
  one-ninth.</p>

  <p>As remarked previously, the grades are not supposed to be separated
  by equal steps. They are numbered in ordinary numerals to distinguish
  them from those in <a href="#table2">Table II.</a></p>

  <p>It clearly appears from this table that the effect of correlation
  between Ability and Environment is to increase, and not to diminish, the
  closeness of association between Success and Ability. Indeed, if the
  correlation were perfect, Success would become an equal measure
  <i>both</i> of Ability and of Favourableness of Environment.</p>

  <p>These arguments are true for each and every branch of Success, and
  are therefore true for all: Ability being construed as Appropriate
  Ability, and Environment as Appropriate Environment.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_R26" id="Page_R26"></a>The general conclusion is that
  Success is, statistically speaking, a magnified, but otherwise
  trustworthy, sign of Ability, high Success being associated with high,
  but not an equally high, grade of Ability, and low with low, but not an
  equally low. A few instances to the contrary no more contradict this
  important general conclusion than a few cases of death at very early or
  at very late ages contradict the tables of expectation of life of a
  newly-born infant.</p>

  <h3><a name="Chapter_VI" id="Chapter_VI"></a>Chapter
  VI.&mdash;Nomenclature of Kinship.</h3>

  <p>Specific kinships are such as &ldquo;paternal uncle&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;maternal uncle,&rdquo; as distinguished from the general term
  &ldquo;uncle.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;first cousin&rdquo; covers no
  less than eight specific kinships (four male and four female), not
  taking the issue of mixed marriages into account. Specific kinships are
  briefly expressed by a nomenclature in which <i>fa</i>, <i>me</i>,
  <i>bro</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>son</i>, <i>da</i>, <i>Hu</i>, <i>Wi</i>,
  stand respectively for <i>father</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>brother</i>,
  <i>sister</i>, <i>son</i>, <i>daughter</i>, <i>Husband</i>, <i>Wife</i>.
  Each of these syllables is supposed to have the possessive <i>'s</i>
  added to it whenever it is followed by another syllable of the set, or
  by the word <i>is</i> when it is not. <i>Example</i>: Let the person
  from whom the kinships are reckoned be called <i>P</i>, and let <i>Q</i>
  and <i>R</i> be two of <i>P'</i>s kinsfolk, described respectively as
  <i>fa bro</i> and <i>me si son</i>. That means that <i>P's father's
  brother</i> is <i>Q</i>, and that <i>P's mother's <a name="Page_R27" id=
  "Page_R27"></a>sister's son</i> is <i>R</i>. It is a simple and easily
  intelligible nomenclature, and replaces intolerable verbiage in the
  description of distant kinships. My correspondents used it freely, and
  none of them spoke of any difficulty in understanding it. Its somewhat
  babyish sound is soon disregarded.</p>

  <p>Those relationships that are expressed by different combinations of
  these letters differ <i>specifically</i>; therefore, in saying, in the
  next chapter, that each person has &ldquo;roughly, on the average, one
  fertile relative in each and every form of specific kinship,&rdquo;
  <a name="Page_R28" id="Page_R28"></a>it means in each and every
  combination of the above syllables that is practically possible.</p>

  <p>Relationship may also be expressed conveniently for some purposes in
  Degrees of remoteness, the number of the Degree being that of the number
  of syllables used to express the specific kinship.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3><a name="Chapter_VII" id="Chapter_VII"></a>Chapter VII.&mdash;Number
  of Kinsfolk in each Degree</h3>

  <p>The population may be likened to counters spread upon a table, each
  corresponding to a different individual. The counters are linked
  together by bands of various widths, down to mere threads, the widths
  being proportional to the closeness of the several kinships. Those in
  the first degree (<i>father</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>brother</i>,
  <i>sister</i>, <i>son</i>, <i>daughter</i>) are comparatively broad;
  those in the second degree (<i>grandparent</i>, <i>uncle</i>,
  <i>aunt</i>, <i>nephew</i>, <i>niece</i>, <i>grandchild</i>) are
  considerably narrower; those in the third degree are very narrow indeed.
  Proceeding outwards, the connections soon become thinner than gossamer.
  The person represented by any one of these counters may be taken as the
  subject of a pedigree, and all the counters connected with it may be
  noted up to any specified width of band. In this book one of the
  counters is supposed to represent a Fellow of the Royal Society, whose
  name appears in the &ldquo;Year-Book&rdquo; of that Society for 1904,
  and the linkage <a name="Page_R29" id="Page_R29"></a>proceeds outwards
  from him to the third degree inclusive. Usually it stops there, but a
  few distant kinships have been occasionally inserted chiefly to testify
  to a prolonged heritage of family traits.</p>

  <p>The intensity with which any specified quality occurs in each or any
  degree of kinship is measured by the proportion between the numbers of
  those who possess the quality in question and the total number of
  persons in that same degree. Particular inquiries were made on the
  latter point, but, as already stated, the answers were incomplete. There
  is, however, enough information to justify three conclusions of primary
  importance to the present inquiry&mdash;namely, the <i>average</i>
  number (1) of brothers of the subject, (2) of brothers of his father,
  and (3) of brothers of his mother.</p>

  <p>The number of Fellows to whom circulars were addressed was 467. The
  number of those who gave useful replies was 207, a little more than
  one-half of whom sent complete returns of the numbers of their brothers
  and uncles; some few of these had, however, placed a query here or
  there, or other sign of hesitation. As the number of completely
  available returns scarcely exceeded 100, I have confined the following
  tables to that number exactly, taking the best of the slightly doubtful
  cases. It would have been possible, by utilizing partial returns and
  making due allowances, to have obtained nearly half as many again, but
  the gain in numbers did not seem likely to be compensated by the
  somewhat inferior quality of the additional data.<a name="Page_R30" id=

  <p>The first three lines of <a href="#table5">Table V.</a> show that there is no significant
  difference between the average numbers of brothers and sisters, nor
  between those of fathers' brothers and fathers' sisters, nor again
  between those of mothers' brothers and mothers' sisters; nor is there
  any large difference between those of male and female cousins, but it is
  apparently a fact that the group of &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; is a trifle
  smaller than that of uncles on either side. It seems, therefore, that
  the generation of the Subjects contains a somewhat smaller number of
  individuals than that of either of their Parents, being to that extent
  significant of a lessening population so far as their class is
  concerned.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_R31" id="Page_R31"></a>It may seem at first sight
  surprising that a brother and a sister should each have the same average
  number of brothers. It puzzled me until I had thought the matter out,
  and when the results were published in &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; it also
  seems to have puzzled an able mathematician, and gave rise to some
  newspaper controversy, which need not be recapitulated. The essence of
  the problem is that the sex of one child is supposed to give no clue of
  any practical importance to that of any other child in the same family.
  Therefore, if one child be selected out of a family of brothers and
  sisters, the proportion of males to females in those that remain will
  be, <i>on the average</i>, identical with that of males to females in
  the population at large. It makes no difference whether the selected
  child be a boy or a girl. Of course, if the conditions were &ldquo;given
  a family of three boys and three girls,&rdquo; each boy would have only
  two brothers and three sisters, and each girl would have three brothers
  and two sisters, but that is not the problem.</p>

  <p>Subject to this explanation, the general accuracy of the observed
  figures which attest the truth of the above conclusion cannot be
  gainsaid on theoretical grounds, nor can the conclusions be ignored to
  which they lead. They enable us to make calculations concerning the
  average number of kinsfolk in each and every specified degree in a
  stationary population, or, if desired, in one that increases or
  decreases at a specified rate. It will here be supposed for convenience
  that the average number of males and <a name="Page_R32" id=
  "Page_R32"></a>females are equal, but any other proportion may be
  substituted. The calculations only regard its fertile members; they show
  that every person has, on the average, about one male fertile relative
  in each and every form of specific kinship.</p>

  <p>Kinsfolk may be divided into direct ancestry, collaterals of all
  kinds, and direct descendants. As regards the direct ancestry, each
  person has one and only one ancestor in each specific degree, one
  <i>fa</i>, one <i>fa fa</i>, one <i>me fa</i>, and so on, although in
  each <i>generic</i> degree it is otherwise; he has two grandfathers,
  four great-grandfathers, etc. With collaterals and descendants the
  average number of <i>fertile</i> relatives in each specified degree must
  be stationary in a stationary population, and calculation shows that
  number is approximately <i>one</i>. The calculation takes no cognizance
  of infertile relatives, and so its results are unaffected by the detail
  whether the population is kept stationary by an increased birth-rate of
  children or other infertiles, accompanied by an increased death-rate
  among them, or contrariwise.</p>

  <p>The exact conclusions were (&ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; September 29, 1904,
  p. 529), that if 2<i>d</i> be the number of children in a family, half
  of them <i>on the average</i> being male, and if the population be
  stationary, the number of fertile males in each specific ancestral
  kinship would be <i>one</i>, in each collateral it would be <i>d</i> -
  1/2, in each descending kinship <i>d</i>. If 2<i>d</i> = 5 (which is a
  common size of family), one of these on the average would be a fertile
  son, one a fertile <a name="Page_R33" id="Page_R33"></a>daughter, and
  the three that remained would leave no issue. They would either die as
  boys or girls or they would remain unmarried, or, if married, would have
  no children.</p>

  <p>The reasonable and approximate assumption I now propose to make is
  that the number of fertile individuals is not grossly different to that
  of those who live long enough to have an opportunity of distinguishing
  themselves. Consequently, the calculations that apply to fertile persons
  will be held to apply very roughly to those who were in a position, so
  far as age is concerned, to achieve noteworthiness, whether they did so
  or not. Thus, if a group of 100 men had between them 20 noteworthy
  paternal uncles, it will be assumed that the total number of their
  paternal uncles who reached mature age was about 100, making the
  intensity of success as 20 to 100, or as 1 to 5. This method of roughly
  evading the serious difficulty arising from ignorance of the true values
  in the individual cases is quite legitimate, and close enough for
  present purposes.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3><a name="Chapter_VIII" id="Chapter_VIII"></a>Chapter
  VIII.&mdash;Number of Noteworthy Kinsmen in each Degree.</h3>

  <p>The materials with which I am dealing do not admit of adequately
  discussing noteworthiness in women, whose opportunities of achieving
  distinction are far fewer than those of men, and whose energies <a name=
  "Page_R34" id="Page_R34"></a>are more severely taxed by domestic and
  social duties. Women have sometimes been accredited in these returns by
  a member of their own family circle, as being gifted with powers at
  least equal to those of their distinguished brothers, but definite facts
  in corroboration of such estimates were rarely supplied.</p>

  <p>The same absence of solid evidence is more or less true of gifted
  youths whose scholastic successes, unless of the highest order, are a
  doubtful indication of future power and performance, these depending
  much on the length of time during which their minds will continue to
  develop. Only a few of the Subjects of the pedigrees in the following
  pages have sons in the full maturity of their powers, so it seemed safer
  to exclude all relatives who were of a lower generation than themselves
  from the statistical inquiry. This will therefore be confined to the
  successes of fathers, brothers, grandfathers, uncles, great-uncles,
  great-grandfathers, and male first cousins.</p>

  <p>Only 207 persons out of the 467 who were addressed sent serviceable
  replies, and these cannot be considered a fair sample of the whole.
  Abstention might have been due to dislike of publicity, to inertia, or
  to pure ignorance, none of which would have much affected the values as
  a sample; but an unquestionably common motive does so
  seriously&mdash;namely, when the person addressed had no noteworthy
  kinsfolk to write about. On the latter ground the 260 who did not reply
  would, as a whole, be poorer in noteworthy kinsmen than the 207 who
  <a name="Page_R35" id="Page_R35"></a>did. The true percentages for the
  467 lie between two limits: the upper limit supposes the richness of the
  207 to be shared by the 260; the lower limit supposes it to be
  concentrated in the 207, the remaining 260 being utterly barren of it.
  Consequently, the upper limit is found by multiplying the number of
  observations by 100 and dividing by 207, the lower by multiplying by 100
  and dividing by 467. These limits are unreasonably wide; I cannot guess
  which is the more remote from the truth, but it cannot be far removed
  from their mean values, and this may be accepted as roughly approximate.
  The observations and conclusions from them are given in <a href="#table7">Table VII.</a>, p.
  <a href="#Page_R40">xl</a>.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX"></a>Chapter IX.&mdash;Marked
  and Unmarked Degrees of Noteworthiness.</h3>

  <p>Persons who are technically &ldquo;noteworthy&rdquo; are by no means
  of equal eminence, some being of the highest distinction, while others
  barely deserve the title. It is therefore important to ascertain the
  amount of error to which a statistical discussion is liable that treats
  everyone who ranks as noteworthy at all on equal terms. The problem
  resembles a familiar one that relates to methods for electing
  Parliamentary representatives, such as have been proposed at various
  times, whether it should be by the coarse method of one man one vote, or
  through <a name="Page_R36" id="Page_R36"></a>some elaborate arrangement
  which seems highly preferable at first sight, but may be found on
  further consideration to lead to much the same results.</p>

  <p>In order to test the question, I marked each noteworthy person whose
  name occurs in the list of sixty-six families at the end of this book
  with 3, 2, or 1, according to what I considered his deserts, and soon
  found that it was easy to mark them with fair consistency. It is not
  necessary to give the rules which guided me, as they were very often
  modified by considerations, each obvious enough in itself, but difficult
  to summarize as a whole. Various provisional trials were made; I then
  began afresh by rejecting a few names as undeserving any mark at all,
  and, having marked the remainder individually, found that a total of 657
  marks had been awarded to 332 persons; 117 of them had received 3 marks;
  101, 2 marks; 104, 1 mark; so the three subdivisions were approximately
  equal in number. The marks being too few to justify detailed treatment,
  I have grouped the kinsmen into first, second, and third degrees, and
  into first cousins, the latter requiring a group to themselves. The
  first degree contains father and brothers; the second, grandfathers and
  uncles; the third, great-grandparents and great-uncles. The results are
  shown in <a href="#table6">Table VI.</a> The marks assigned to each of the groups are given in
  the first line (total 657), and the number of the noteworthy persons in
  each group who received any mark at all is shown in the third line
  (total 329). In order to compare the first and third <a name="Page_R37"
  id="Page_R37"></a>lines of entries on equal terms, those in the first
  were multiplied by 329 and divided by 657, and then entered in the
  second line. The closeness of resemblance between the second and third
  lines emphatically answers the question to be solved. There is no
  significant difference between the results of the marked and the
  unmarked observations. The reason probably is that the distribution of
  triple, double, and single marks separately is much the same in each of
  the groups, and therefore remains alike when the three sets of marks are
  in use at the same time. It is thus made clear that trouble taken in
  carefully marking names for different degrees of noteworthiness would be
  wasted in such a rough inquiry as this.</p>

  <p><a href="#table7">Table VII.</a>, in the next chapter, affords an interesting illustration
  of the character of the ignorance <a name="Page_R38" id=
  "Page_R38"></a>concerning the noteworthiness of kinsmen in distant
  degrees, showing that it is much lessened when they bear the same
  surname as their father, or even as the maiden surname of their mother.
  The argument is this: <a href="#table5">Table V.</a> has already shown that <i>me bros</i>
  are, speaking roughly, as frequently noteworthy as <i>fa
  bros</i>&mdash;fifty-two of the one to forty-five of the other&mdash;so
  noteworthiness is so far an equal characteristic of the maternal and
  paternal lines, resembling in that respect nearly all the qualities that
  are transmitted purely through heredity. There ought, therefore, to be
  as many persons recorded as noteworthy in each of the four different
  kinds of great-grandparents. The same should be the case in each of the
  four kinds of great-uncles. But this is not so in either case. The
  noteworthy great-grandfathers, <i>fa fa fa</i>, who bear the same name
  as the subject are twice as numerous as the <i>me fa fa</i> who bear the
  maiden surname of the mother, and more than five times as numerous as
  either of the other two, the <i>fa me fa</i> and <i>me me fa</i>, whose
  surnames differ from both, unless it be through some accident, whether
  of a cross marriage or a chance similarity of names. It is just the same
  with the great-uncles. Now, the figures for great-grandfathers and
  great-uncles run so closely alike that they may fairly be grouped
  together, in order to obtain a more impressive whole&mdash;namely, two
  sorts of these kinsmen, bearing the same name as the Subject, contain
  between them 23 noteworthies, or 11.50 each; two sorts having the
  mother's maiden surname contain together 11 noteworthies, <a name=
  "Page_R39" id="Page_R39"></a>or 5.50 each; four sorts containing between
  them 7 names, or an average of 1.75 each. These figures are
  self-consistent, being each the sum of two practically equal
  constituents, and they are sufficiently numerous to be significant. The
  remarkable differences in their numbers, 11.50, 5.50, 1.75, when they
  ought to have been equal, has therefore to be accounted for, and the
  explanation given above seems both reasonable and sufficient.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3><a name="Chapter_X" id="Chapter_X"></a>Chapter
  X.&mdash;Conclusions.</h3>

  <p>The most casual glance at <a href="#table7">Table VII.</a> leaves no doubt as to the rapid
  diminution in the frequency of noteworthiness as the distance of kinship
  to the F.R.S. increases, and it would presumably do the same to any
  other class of noteworthy persons.</p>

  <p>In drawing more exact conclusions, the returns must be deemed to
  refer not to a group of 207 F.R.S., because they are not a fair sample
  of the whole body of 467, and, for reasons already given, they are too
  rich in noteworthiness for the one and too poor for the other. They
  will, therefore, be referred to the number that is the mean of these two
  limits&mdash;namely, to 337. I am aware of no obvious guidance to any
  better hypothesis.</p>

  <p>The value of the expectation that noteworthiness would be found in
  any specified kinsman of an <a name="Page_R40" id="Page_R40"></a>F.R.S.,
  of whom nothing else is known, may be easily calculated from <a href="#table7">Table VII.</a>
  on the two hypotheses already mentioned and justified: (1) That the
  figures should be taken to refer to 337, and not to 207; (2) that 1 per
  cent. of the generality are noteworthy&mdash;that is to say, there are
  3.37 noteworthies to every 337 persons of the generality.</p>

  <p>Thus, for the fathers of F.R.S., 81 are recorded as noteworthy,
  against 3.37 of fathers of the generality&mdash;that is, they are 24.1
  times as numerous. For the first cousins of F.R.S. there are 99
  noteworthies, divided amongst four kinds of male first-cousins, or 24.75
  on an average to each kind, against the 3.37 of the
  generality&mdash;that is, they are 7.3 times as numerous.</p>

  <p>On this principle the expectation of noteworthiness <a name=
  "Page_R41" id="Page_R41"></a>in a kinsman of an F.R.S. (or of other
  noteworthy person) is greater in the following proportion than in one
  who has no such kinsman: If he be a father, 24 times as great; if a
  brother, 31 times; if a grandfather, 12 times; if an uncle, 14 times; if
  a male first cousin, 7 times; if a great-great-grandfather on the
  paternal line, 3&frac12; times.</p>

  <p>The reader may work out results for himself on other hypotheses as to
  the percentage of noteworthiness among the generality. A considerably
  larger proportion would be noteworthy in the higher classes of society,
  but a far smaller one in the lower; it is to the bulk, say, to
  three-quarters of them, that the 1 per cent. estimate applies, the
  extreme variations from it tending to balance one another.</p>

  <p>The figures on which the above calculations depend may each or all of
  them be changed to any reasonable amount, without shaking the truth of
  the great fact upon which Eugenics is based, that able fathers produce
  able children in a much larger proportion than the generality.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:2em;"><a name="Page_R42" id="Page_R42"></a>The
  parents of the 207 Fellows of the Royal Society occupy a wide variety of
  social positions. A list is given in the Appendix of the more or less
  noteworthy parents of those Fellows whose names occur in the list of
  sixty-six families. The parents are classified according to their
  pursuits. Many parents of the other Fellows in the 207 families were not
  noteworthy in the technical sense of the word, but were reported to be
  able. It was also often said in the replies that the general level of
  ability among the members of the family of the F.R.S. was high. Other
  parents were in no way remarkable, so the future Fellow was simply a
  &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; to use the language of horticulturists and
  breeders, in respect to his taste and ability. It is to be remembered
  that &ldquo;sports&rdquo; are transmissible by heredity, and have been,
  through careful selection, the origin of most of the valuable varieties
  of domesticated plants and animals. Sports have been conspicuous in the
  human race, especially in some individuals of the highest eminence in
  music, painting, and in art generally, but this is not the place to
  enter further into so large a subject. It has been treated at length by
  many writers, especially by Bateson and De Vries, also by myself in the
  third chapter of &ldquo;Natural Inheritance&rdquo; and in the preface to
  the second edition of &ldquo;Hereditary Genius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>I gather from this that about 21
  of the 38 sons have followed the same pursuits as their parents, and
  that the remaining 17 have followed different ones; but the distinction
  is not always clear, so other persons may form slightly different
  estimates. Anyhow, it appears that the two characteristics of (1)
  general ability and (2) a passion for a particular pursuit are
  transmitted more or less independently.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
